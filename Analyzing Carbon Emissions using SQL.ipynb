PCFs are the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to a given product, measured in CO<sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide equivalent).\n\nThis data is stored in a PostgreSQL database containing one table, `prouduct_emissions`, which looks at PCFs by product as well as the stage of production that these emissions occurred. Here's a snapshot of what `product_emissions` contains in each column:\n\n### `product_emissions`\n\n| field                              | data type |\n|------------------------------------|-----------|\n| `id`                                 | `VARCHAR`   |\n| `year`                               | `INT`       |\n| `product_name`                       | `VARCHAR`   |\n| `company`                            | `VARCHAR`   |\n| `country`                            | `VARCHAR`   |\n| `industry_group`                     | `VARCHAR`   |\n| `weight_kg`                          | `NUMERIC`   |\n| `carbon_footprint_pcf`               | `NUMERIC`   |\n| `upstream_percent_total_pcf`         | `VARCHAR`   |\n| `operations_percent_total_pcf`       | `VARCHAR`   |\n| `downstream_percent_total_pcf`       | `VARCHAR`   |\n\nYou'll use this data to examine the carbon footprint of each industry in the dataset!","metadata":{"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6"},"id":"d0eb4f16-5a99-460d-a5ba-706b7ef0bbe7","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"-- Total Industry Footprint by Industry Group\n\nSELECT industry_group, COUNT(DISTINCT(company)) as num_companies, ROUND(SUM(carbon_footprint_pcf), 1) as total_industry_footprint\nFROM product_emissions\nWHERE year in (select max(year) from product_emissions)\nGROUP BY industry_group\nORDER BY total_industry_footprint DESC;
